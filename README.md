# lazyscript
i dont want to memorize commands while learning parrot tools sooo this.


If you downloaded this in hopes that you would find some hiden gem of a
program, well.... nope you just wasted your bandwidth. This is just a 
little script im working on because im to lazy to memorize commands.
over time it will grow and maybe some day worth downloading. But as of now
it was a waste of bandwidth.
current functions

#11 is actuall intresting. it is the only functional script that is worth a look.
it streamlines using hcx to collect wifi hashes, converts to txt, and will
crack using wordlists. only requiring the user to enter 4 variables.
i havent spent any time on anything else yet. But my goal is to make everything i
put on here as user friendly and simple as i can. with nearly zero memorization!

if your still intrested in my pretty much pointless little script then all
you need to do to install is 

	chmon +x Project_V3N0M0US/install.sh
	cd Project_V3N0M0US/	
	./install.sh

then to run cd into the folder and
	./venomous.sh 
and i suggest running option 21 if you dont have parrot or kali installed.

any other way and some of the functions will fail. I dont know why and i
dont really care.
